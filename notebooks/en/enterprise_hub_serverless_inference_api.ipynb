    "Hugging Face provides a [Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) as a way for users to quickly test and evaluate over 500,000 publicly accessible (or your own privately permissioned) machine learning models ***for free*** with simple API calls!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook recipe, we'll demonstrate how to get started using the Serverless Inference API for several different tasks including:\n",
    "1. Generating text with popular open LLM's\n",
    "2. Creating images with stable diffusion\n",
    "3. Transcribing audio files with Whisper\n",
    "4. Visual question answering against PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Because we offer the Serverless Inference API for free, the service has rate limits for regular Hugging Face users (~ few hundred requests per hour). For access to higher rate limits, you can [upgrade to a PRO account](https://huggingface.co/subscribe/pro) for just $9 per month. However, for high-volume, production inference workloads, check out our [Dedicated Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) solution.\n"
