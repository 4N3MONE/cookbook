In this tutorial, we've done this part for you and the definitions are stored in memory as a list. Scaling up from this example might require more sophisticated storage.\n","* The user enters a query in natural language.\n","* [Jina Reranker](https://jina.ai/reranker/) \\([`jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual`](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual)), an SQL-aware reranking model from [Jina AI](https://jina.ai), sorts the table definitions in order of their relevance to the user's query.\n","* We present [Mistral 7B Instruct v0.1 \\(`mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`)](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) with a prompt containing the user's query and the top three table definitions, with a request to write an SQL query to fit the task.\n","* Mistral Instruct generates an SQL query and we run it against the database, retrieving a result.\n","* The SQL query result is converted to JSON and presented to Mistral Instruct in a new prompt, along with the user's original query, the SQL query, and a request to compose an answer for the user in natural language.\n","* Mistral Instruct's natural language text response is returned to the user.\n","\n","### The Database\n","\n","For this tutorial, we are using a small open-access database of video game sales records [stored on GitHub](https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_videogames/sqlite). We will be using the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) version because SQLite is very compact, cross-platform, and has built-in Python support.\n","\n","### Software and Hardware Requirements\n","\n","We will be running the Jina Reranker model locally. If you are using Google Colab to run this notebook, make sure you are using a runtime that has access to a GPU. If you are running it locally, you will need Python 3 \\(this tutorial was authored using a Python 3.11 installation) and it will run *much* faster with a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n","\n","We will also use the open-source [LlamaIndex RAG framework](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) extensively in this tutorial, and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api/serverless) to access Mistral 7B Instruct v0.1. You will need a [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/login) and an [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with at least `READ` access.\n","\n","> ![](data:image/png;base64,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)\n",">\n","> If you are using Google Colab, SQLite is already installed.

You might want to use a two-stage process, where an embedding model and vector store initially retrieve more results, but the reranker model prunes that down to whatever number you are able to put into a prompt for an generative language model.\n","\n","This notebook has assumed no request requires more than three tables to satisfy, and obviously in practice this cannot always be true. Mistral 7B Instruct v0.1 is not guaranteed to produce correct (or even executable) SQL output. In production, something like this requires much more in-depth error handling.\n","\n","More sophisticated error handling, longer input context windows, and generative models specialized in SQL-specific tasks might make a big difference in practical applications.\n","\n","Nonetheless, you can see here how the RAG concept extends to structured databases, expanding its scope for use dramatically."],"metadata":{"id":"-srB-MOMk1b-"},"id":"-srB-MOMk1b-"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
