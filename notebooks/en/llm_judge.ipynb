    "# Using LLM-as-a-judge üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è for an automated and versatile evaluation \n",
    "_Authored by: [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of Large language models (LLMs) is often a difficult endeavour: given their broad capabilities, the tasks given to them often should be judged on requirements that would be very broad, and loosely-defined. For instance, an assistant's answer to a question can be:\n",
    "- not grounded in context\n",
    "- repetitive, repetitive, repetitive\n",
    "- grammatically incorrects\n",
    "- Excessively lengthy and characterized by an overabundance of words, leading to a situation where the discourse or written content becomes overly detailed and protracted\n",
    "- incoherent\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of criteria goes on and on. And even if we had a limited list, each of these would be hard to mesure: \"devising a rule-based program to assess the outputs is extremely challenging. Traditional evaluation metrics based on the similarity between outputs and reference answers (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) are also ineffective for these questions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ A powerful solution to assess outputs in a human way, without requiring costly human time, is LLM-as-a-judge.\n",
    "This method was introduced in [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.05685) - which I encourage you to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° The idea is simple: ask an LLM to do the grading for you. ü§ñ‚úì \n",
    "\n",
    "But we'll see that it will not work well out-of-the-box: you need to set it up carefully for good results."

    "\n",
    "In our case, we will use [`feedbackQA`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/McGill-NLP/feedbackQA), which contains 2 human evaluations and scores for each question/answer couple: using a sample of 30 examples will be representative of what your small evaluation dataset could be."
