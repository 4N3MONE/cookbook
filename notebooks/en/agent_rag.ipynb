    "# Self-correcting RAG with an Agent\n",
    "_Authored by: [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric)_\n",
    "\n",
    "> This tutorial is advanced. You should have notions from [this other cookbook](advanced_rag) first!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Reminder: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is ‚Äúusing an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base‚Äù. It has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "But vanilla RAG has limitations:\n",
    "- It **performs only one retrieval step** of retrieval**: if the results are bad, the generation in turn will be bad.\n",
    "- **Documents are retrieved or not based on semantic similarity with the user query**: but for instance, if the user query is a question and the document containing the true answer is in affirmative voice, its similarity score will be downgraded compared to other questions, so it might not be ranked high enough to be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many frameworks have been proposed to alleviate these problems, with ideas in this vein:\n",
    "- Instead of directly using the user query in semantic search, let the LLM formulate a sentence closer to the documents ([HyDE](https://huggingface.co/papers/2212.10496))\n",
    "- Critique the generated snippets and re-retrieve if needed as in [Self-Query](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/evaluation/RetryQuery/)\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can recover both these by making a **RAG agent: very simply, an agent armed with a retriever tool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent will: ‚úÖ Formulate the query itself and ‚úÖ Critique to re-retrieve if needed. So it should naively recover some advanced RAG techniques!\n",
