    "# Agentic RAG: turbocharge your RAG with query reformulation and self-query! üöÄ\n",
    "_Authored by: [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric)_\n",
    "\n",
    "> This tutorial is advanced. You should have notions from [this other cookbook](advanced_rag) first!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Reminder: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is ‚Äúusing an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base‚Äù. It has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "But vanilla RAG has limitations, most importantly these two:\n",
    "- It **performs only one retrieval step**: if the results are bad, the generation in turn will be bad.\n",
    "- __Semantic similarity is computed with the *user query* as a reference__, which might be suboptimal: for instance, the user query will often be a question and the document containing the true answer will be in affirmative voice, so its similarity score will be downgraded compared to other source documents in the interrogative form, leading to a risk of missing the relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can alleviate these problems by making a **RAG agent: very simply, an agent armed with a retriever tool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent will: ‚úÖ Formulate the query itself and ‚úÖ Critique to re-retrieve if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it should naively recover some advanced RAG techniques!\n",
    "- Instead of directly using the user query as the reference in semantic search, the agent formulates itself a reference sentence that can be closer to the targeted documents, as in [HyDE](https://huggingface.co/papers/2212.10496)\n",
    "- The agent can the generated snippets and re-retrieve if needed, as in [Self-Query](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/evaluation/RetryQuery/)\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer: The Diffusers library is a comprehensive and accessible toolbox for working with diffusion models, focusing on state-of-the-art pretrained models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. It is designed with simplicity, accessibility, reproducibility, and responsibility in mind. The library offers three core components: Models, Scripts, and Tokenizers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Models component provides pretrained diffusion models and custom diffusion system building blocks. The Scripts component includes example scripts and training examples to demonstrate how to effectively use the library for training and fine-tuning. Lastly, the Tokenizers component offers efficient and versatile implementations of popular tokenizers, a critical step in preparing inputs for diffusion models.\n",

      "Question: What is the purpose of the two-stage model proposed in the paper \"Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The purpose of the two-stage model is to generate images from text captions. The first stage of the model, the prior, turns a text caption into a CLIP image embedding. In the second stage, a diffusion model decodes this embedding into an image. This process enables the generation of images that preserve semantics and style while allowing variation in non-essential details. This two-stage approach improves image diversity while maintaining photorealism and caption similarity.\n",
      "True answer: The purpose of the two-stage model is to generate a CLIP image embedding given a text caption and then generate an image conditioned on the image embedding.\n"

      "Answer: Apologies for the errors and delay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) is a technique used in distributed training to improve memory efficiency and training speed, especially for large models. It involves partitioning or sharding model parameters across data parallel processes, enabling more efficient utilization of compute resources. This sharding reduces memory consumption per process, allowing training of large models on a greater number of accelerator-equipped nodes. Memory bandwidth is also better utilized, as parameter updates are exchanged between nodes, improving the overall training speed. FSDP is particularly beneficial for training large language models, where memory requirements can be prodigious.\n",
      "True answer: FSDP is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters by sharding the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data parallel processes.\n"

In short, the tutorials provide a comprehensive guide to utilizing Diffusers for various applications, with a focus on usability and customizability.\n",

PyTorch provides the \"torch.distributed\" package and the \"torch.multiprocessing\" package to run a script on multiple GPUs.
