        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Therefore, even though the model's response may vary due to the request for a short answer in the second question, the information to retrieve from the vector database will be the same. This is why I'm placing the cache system between the user and the database, not between the user and the Large Language Model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the semantic cache is to search only for similarities among different user queries, not among the prompts sent to the Large Language Model. In a real project, the user's question is just one part of the prompt; it typically travels along with contextual information and specific instructions on how the response format is expected.\n",

Of the one to four million Americans who have CFS, less than 20% have been diagnosed.\\n  Exams and Screening Tests for CFS\\n  \\nBecause there is no blood test, brain scan, or other lab test to diagnose CFS, the doctor should first rule out other possible causes.\\n  \\nIf a patient has had 6 or more consecutive months of severe fatigue that is reported to be unrelieved by sufficient bed rest and that is accompanied by nonspecific symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, generalized pain, and memory problems, the doctor should consider the possibility that the patient may have CFS. Further exams and tests are needed before a diagnosis can be made:\\n  \\n   - A detailed medical history will be needed and should include a review of medications that could be causing the fatigue and symptoms\\n   - A thorough physical and mental status examination will also be needed\\n   - A battery of laboratory screening tests will be needed to help identify or rule out other possible causes of the symptoms that could be treated\\n   - The doctor may also order additional tests to follow up on results of the initial screening tests\\n  \\n  \\nA CFS diagnosis requires that the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more and has 4 of the 8 symptoms for CFS for 6 months or more. If, however, the patient has been fatigued for 6 months or more but does not have four of the eight symptoms, the diagnosis may be idiopathic fatigue.\\n  \\nThe complete process for diagnosing CFS can be found here.\\n  \\nAdditional information for healthcare professionals on use of tests can be found here.\",\n          \"Eating, diet, and nutrition have not been shown to play a role in causing or preventing simple kidney cysts.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4736,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 16406,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16407,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3634,\n          15104,\n          4395\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They protect against things like measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.    Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does, the immune system \"remembers\" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity.     Before vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.
