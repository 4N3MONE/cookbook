    "# RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), by building a synthetic evaluation dataset and using LLM-as-a-judge to compute the accuracy of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction to RAG, you can check [this other cookbook](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook/blob/main/notebooks/RAG_zephyr_langchain.ipynb)!\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems are complex, with many moving parts: here a RAG diagram, where we noted in blue all possibilities for system enhancement:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/RAG_workflow.png\" height=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing any of these improvements can bring a huge performance boost; but changing anything is useless if you cannot monitor the impact of your changes on the system's performance!\n",
    "So let's see how to evaluate our RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating RAG performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    "- an evaluation dataset\n",
    "- an evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    "- the evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM 🤖, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs 🤖\n",
    "- the evaluation will then be run on this synthetic dataset by a LLM-as-a-judge agent 🤖.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Let's dig into it and start building our evaluation pipeline!__ First, we install the required model dependancies."

Our BARTpho uses the \"large\" architecture and pre-training\\nscheme of the sequence-to-sequence denoising model BART, thus especially suitable for generative NLP tasks. Experiments\\non a downstream task of Vietnamese text summarization show that in both automatic and human evaluations, our BARTpho\\noutperforms the strong baseline mBART and improves the state-of-the-art. We release BARTpho to facilitate future\\nresearch and applications of generative Vietnamese NLP tasks.*\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [dqnguyen](https://huggingface.co/dqnguyen). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/BARTpho).\\n\\n## Usage example\\n\\n```python\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bartpho = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; line = \"Chúng tôi là những nghiên cứu viên.\"\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; input_ids = tokenizer(line, return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with torch.no_grad():\\n...     features = bartpho(**input_ids)  # Models outputs are now tuples\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # With TensorFlow 2.0+:\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import TFAutoModel\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bartpho = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; input_ids = tokenizer(line, return_tensors=\"tf\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; features = bartpho(**input_ids)\\n```\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\n- Following mBART, BARTpho uses the \"large\" architecture of BART with an additional layer-normalization layer on top of\\n  both the encoder and decoder. Thus, usage examples in the [documentation of BART](bart), when adapting to use\\n  with BARTpho, should be adjusted by replacing the BART-specialized classes with the mBART-specialized counterparts.\\n  For example:\\n\\n```python\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import MBartForConditionalGeneration\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bartpho = MBartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; TXT = \"Chúng tôi là &lt;mask&gt; nghiên cứu viên.\"\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; input_ids = tokenizer([TXT], return_tensors=\"pt\")[\"input_ids\"]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; logits = bartpho(input_ids).logits\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; masked_index = (input_ids[0] == tokenizer.mask_token_id).nonzero().item()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; probs = logits[0, masked_index].softmax(dim=0)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; values, predictions = probs.topk(5)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(tokenizer.decode(predictions).split())\\n```\\n\\n- This implementation is only for tokenization: \"monolingual_vocab_file\" consists of Vietnamese-specialized types\\n  extracted from the pre-trained SentencePiece model \"vocab_file\" that is available from the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa.\\n  Other languages, if employing this pre-trained multilingual SentencePiece model \"vocab_file\" for subword\\n  segmentation, can reuse BartphoTokenizer with their own language-specialized \"monolingual_vocab_file\".\\n\\n## BartphoTokenizer\\n\\n[[autodoc]] BartphoTokenizer\\n</td>\n",

It has the same structure as the model introduced as Prefix LM\\nin the T5 paper, and support both Text Generation and Masked Language Modeling tasks. These basic tasks similarly can\\nfine-tune for translation or summarization.\\n\\n### Usage example\\n\\nThe `generate()` method can be used to generate text using GPTSAN-Japanese model.\\n\\n```python\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese\").cuda()\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x_tok = tokenizer(\"は、\", prefix_text=\"織田信長\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; torch.manual_seed(0)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gen_tok = model.generate(x_tok.input_ids.cuda(), token_type_ids=x_tok.token_type_ids.cuda(), max_new_tokens=20)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.decode(gen_tok[0])\\n'織田信長は、2004年に『戦国BASARA』のために、豊臣秀吉'\\n```\\n\\n## GPTSAN Features\\n\\nGPTSAN has some unique features. It has a model structure of Prefix-LM. It works as a shifted Masked Language Model for Prefix Input tokens. Un-prefixed inputs behave like normal generative models.\\nThe Spout vector is a GPTSAN specific input. Spout is pre-trained with random inputs, but you can specify a class of text or an arbitrary vector during fine-tuning. This allows you to indicate the tendency of the generated text.\\nGPTSAN has a sparse Feed Forward based on Switch-Transformer. You can also add other layers and train them partially. See the original GPTSAN repository for details.\\n\\n### Prefix-LM Model\\n\\nGPTSAN has the structure of the model named Prefix-LM in the `T5` paper. (The original GPTSAN repository calls it `hybrid`)\\nIn GPTSAN, the `Prefix` part of Prefix-LM, that is, the input position that can be referenced by both tokens, can be specified with any length.\\nArbitrary lengths can also be specified differently for each batch.\\nThis length applies to the text entered in `prefix_text` for the tokenizer.\\nThe tokenizer returns the mask of the `Prefix` part of Prefix-LM as `token_type_ids`.\\nThe model treats the part where `token_type_ids` is 1 as a `Prefix` part, that is, the input can refer to both tokens before and after.\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\nSpecifying the Prefix part is done with a mask passed to self-attention.\\nWhen token_type_ids=None or all zero, it is equivalent to regular causal mask\\n\\nfor example:\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x_token = tokenizer(\"ｱｲｳｴ\")\\ninput_ids:      | SOT | SEG | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ |\\ntoken_type_ids: | 1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\nprefix_lm_mask:\\nSOT | 1 0 0 0 0 0 |\\nSEG | 1 1 0 0 0 0 |\\nｱ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nｲ   | 1 1 1 1 0 0 |\\nｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x_token = tokenizer(\"\", prefix_text=\"ｱｲｳｴ\")\\ninput_ids:      | SOT | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ | SEG |\\ntoken_type_ids: | 1   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  |\\nprefix_lm_mask:\\nSOT | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｱ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｲ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nSEG | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x_token = tokenizer(\"ｳｴ\", prefix_text=\"ｱｲ\")\\ninput_ids:      | SOT | ｱ | ｲ | SEG | ｳ | ｴ |\\ntoken_type_ids: | 1   | 1 | 1 | 0   | 0 | 0 |\\nprefix_lm_mask:\\nSOT | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nｱ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nｲ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nSEG | 1 1 1 1 0 0 |\\nｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |\\n\\n### Spout Vector\\n\\nA Spout Vector is a special vector for controlling text generation.\\nThis vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens.\\nIn the pre-trained model published from `Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese`, the Spout Vector is a 128-dimensional vector that passes through 8 fully connected layers in the model and is projected into the space acting as external attention.\\nThe Spout Vector projected by the fully connected layer is split to be passed to all self-attentions.\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseConfig\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseConfig\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseModel\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseModel\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\\n    - forward\\n</td>\n",

It is a GPT-2-like\\ncausal language model trained on [the Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) dataset.\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [Stella Biderman](https://huggingface.co/stellaathena).\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\n- To load [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) in float32 one would need at least 2x model size\\n  RAM: 1x for initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. So for GPT-J it would take at least 48GB\\n  RAM to just load the model. To reduce the RAM usage there are a few options. The `torch_dtype` argument can be\\n  used to initialize the model in half-precision on a CUDA device only. There is also a fp16 branch which stores the fp16 weights,\\n  which could be used to further minimize the RAM usage:\\n\\n```python\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import GPTJForCausalLM\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; device = \"cuda\"\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model = GPTJForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\n...     \"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\",\\n...     revision=\"float16\",\\n...     torch_dtype=torch.float16,\\n... ).to(device)\\n```\\n\\n- The model should fit on 16GB GPU for inference. For training/fine-tuning it would take much more GPU RAM. Adam\\n  optimizer for example makes four copies of the model: model, gradients, average and squared average of the gradients.\\n  So it would need at least 4x model size GPU memory, even with mixed precision as gradient updates are in fp32. This\\n  is not including the activations and data batches, which would again require some more GPU RAM. So one should explore\\n  solutions such as DeepSpeed, to train/fine-tune the model. Another option is to use the original codebase to\\n  train/fine-tune the model on TPU and then convert the model to Transformers format for inference. Instructions for\\n  that could be found [here](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/howto_finetune.md)\\n\\n- Although the embedding matrix has a size of 50400, only 50257 entries are used by the GPT-2 tokenizer. These extra\\n  tokens are added for the sake of efficiency on TPUs. To avoid the mismatch between embedding matrix size and vocab\\n  size, the tokenizer for [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) contains 143 extra tokens\\n  `&lt;|extratoken_1|&gt;... &lt;|extratoken_143|&gt;`, so the `vocab_size` of tokenizer also becomes 50400.\\n\\n## Usage examples\\n\\nThe [`~generation.GenerationMixin.generate`] method can be used to generate text using GPT-J\\nmodel.\\n\\n```python\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt = (\\n...     \"In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, \"\\n...     \"previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains.

Including syntax highlighting and Github Flavoured Markdown. We also have more consistent markdown behaviour and styling.\\n\\n##### Various performance improvements\\n\\nThese improvements will be particularly beneficial to large applications.\\n\\n- Rather than attaching events manually, they are now delegated, leading to a significant performance improvement and addressing a performance regression introduced in a recent version of Gradio. App startup for large applications is now around twice as fast.\\n- Optimised the mounting of individual components, leading to a modest performance improvement during startup (~30%).\\n- Corrected an issue that was causing markdown to re-render infinitely.\\n- Ensured that the `gr.3DModel` does re-render prematurely.\\n\\nThanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)!\\n\\n### Fixes\\n\\n- [#5285](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5285) [`cdfd4217`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/cdfd42174a9c777eaee9c1209bf8e90d8c7791f2) - Tweaks to `icon` parameter in `gr.Button()`.

Our BARTpho uses the \"large\" architecture and pre-training\\nscheme of the sequence-to-sequence denoising model BART, thus especially suitable for generative NLP tasks. Experiments\\non a downstream task of Vietnamese text summarization show that in both automatic and human evaluations, our BARTpho\\noutperforms the strong baseline mBART and improves the state-of-the-art. We release BARTpho to facilitate future\\nresearch and applications of generative Vietnamese NLP tasks.*\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [dqnguyen](https://huggingface.co/dqnguyen). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/BARTpho).\\n\\n## Usage example\\n\\n```python\\n>>> import torch\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\\n\\n>>> bartpho = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n\\n>>> line = \"Chúng tôi là những nghiên cứu viên.\"\\n\\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(line, return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n\\n>>> with torch.no_grad():\\n...     features = bartpho(**input_ids)  # Models outputs are now tuples\\n\\n>>> # With TensorFlow 2.0+:\\n>>> from transformers import TFAutoModel\\n\\n>>> bartpho = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(line, return_tensors=\"tf\")\\n>>> features = bartpho(**input_ids)\\n```\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\n- Following mBART, BARTpho uses the \"large\" architecture of BART with an additional layer-normalization layer on top of\\n  both the encoder and decoder. Thus, usage examples in the [documentation of BART](bart), when adapting to use\\n  with BARTpho, should be adjusted by replacing the BART-specialized classes with the mBART-specialized counterparts.\\n  For example:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import MBartForConditionalGeneration\\n\\n>>> bartpho = MBartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"vinai/bartpho-syllable\")\\n>>> TXT = \"Chúng tôi là <mask> nghiên cứu viên.\"\\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer([TXT], return_tensors=\"pt\")[\"input_ids\"]\\n>>> logits = bartpho(input_ids).logits\\n>>> masked_index = (input_ids[0] == tokenizer.mask_token_id).nonzero().item()\\n>>> probs = logits[0, masked_index].softmax(dim=0)\\n>>> values, predictions = probs.topk(5)\\n>>> print(tokenizer.decode(predictions).split())\\n```\\n\\n- This implementation is only for tokenization: \"monolingual_vocab_file\" consists of Vietnamese-specialized types\\n  extracted from the pre-trained SentencePiece model \"vocab_file\" that is available from the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa.\\n  Other languages, if employing this pre-trained multilingual SentencePiece model \"vocab_file\" for subword\\n  segmentation, can reuse BartphoTokenizer with their own language-specialized \"monolingual_vocab_file\".\\n\\n## BartphoTokenizer\\n\\n[[autodoc]] BartphoTokenizer\\n   \n",

It has the same structure as the model introduced as Prefix LM\\nin the T5 paper, and support both Text Generation and Masked Language Modeling tasks. These basic tasks similarly can\\nfine-tune for translation or summarization.\\n\\n### Usage example\\n\\nThe `generate()` method can be used to generate text using GPTSAN-Japanese model.\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer\\n>>> import torch\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese\")\\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese\").cuda()\\n>>> x_tok = tokenizer(\"は、\", prefix_text=\"織田信長\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n>>> torch.manual_seed(0)\\n>>> gen_tok = model.generate(x_tok.input_ids.cuda(), token_type_ids=x_tok.token_type_ids.cuda(), max_new_tokens=20)\\n>>> tokenizer.decode(gen_tok[0])\\n'織田信長は、2004年に『戦国BASARA』のために、豊臣秀吉'\\n```\\n\\n## GPTSAN Features\\n\\nGPTSAN has some unique features. It has a model structure of Prefix-LM. It works as a shifted Masked Language Model for Prefix Input tokens. Un-prefixed inputs behave like normal generative models.\\nThe Spout vector is a GPTSAN specific input. Spout is pre-trained with random inputs, but you can specify a class of text or an arbitrary vector during fine-tuning. This allows you to indicate the tendency of the generated text.\\nGPTSAN has a sparse Feed Forward based on Switch-Transformer. You can also add other layers and train them partially. See the original GPTSAN repository for details.\\n\\n### Prefix-LM Model\\n\\nGPTSAN has the structure of the model named Prefix-LM in the `T5` paper. (The original GPTSAN repository calls it `hybrid`)\\nIn GPTSAN, the `Prefix` part of Prefix-LM, that is, the input position that can be referenced by both tokens, can be specified with any length.\\nArbitrary lengths can also be specified differently for each batch.\\nThis length applies to the text entered in `prefix_text` for the tokenizer.\\nThe tokenizer returns the mask of the `Prefix` part of Prefix-LM as `token_type_ids`.\\nThe model treats the part where `token_type_ids` is 1 as a `Prefix` part, that is, the input can refer to both tokens before and after.\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\nSpecifying the Prefix part is done with a mask passed to self-attention.\\nWhen token_type_ids=None or all zero, it is equivalent to regular causal mask\\n\\nfor example:\\n\\n>>> x_token = tokenizer(\"ｱｲｳｴ\")\\ninput_ids:      | SOT | SEG | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ |\\ntoken_type_ids: | 1   | 0   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\nprefix_lm_mask:\\nSOT | 1 0 0 0 0 0 |\\nSEG | 1 1 0 0 0 0 |\\nｱ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nｲ   | 1 1 1 1 0 0 |\\nｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |\\n\\n>>> x_token = tokenizer(\"\", prefix_text=\"ｱｲｳｴ\")\\ninput_ids:      | SOT | ｱ | ｲ | ｳ | ｴ | SEG |\\ntoken_type_ids: | 1   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0  |\\nprefix_lm_mask:\\nSOT | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｱ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｲ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nSEG | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |\\n\\n>>> x_token = tokenizer(\"ｳｴ\", prefix_text=\"ｱｲ\")\\ninput_ids:      | SOT | ｱ | ｲ | SEG | ｳ | ｴ |\\ntoken_type_ids: | 1   | 1 | 1 | 0   | 0 | 0 |\\nprefix_lm_mask:\\nSOT | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nｱ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nｲ   | 1 1 1 0 0 0 |\\nSEG | 1 1 1 1 0 0 |\\nｳ   | 1 1 1 1 1 0 |\\nｴ   | 1 1 1 1 1 1 |\\n\\n### Spout Vector\\n\\nA Spout Vector is a special vector for controlling text generation.\\nThis vector is treated as the first embedding in self-attention to bring extraneous attention to the generated tokens.\\nIn the pre-trained model published from `Tanrei/GPTSAN-japanese`, the Spout Vector is a 128-dimensional vector that passes through 8 fully connected layers in the model and is projected into the space acting as external attention.\\nThe Spout Vector projected by the fully connected layer is split to be passed to all self-attentions.\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseConfig\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseConfig\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseTokenizer\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseModel\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseModel\\n\\n## GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\\n\\n[[autodoc]] GPTSanJapaneseForConditionalGeneration\\n    - forward\\n   \n",

It is a GPT-2-like\\ncausal language model trained on [the Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) dataset.\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [Stella Biderman](https://huggingface.co/stellaathena).\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\n- To load [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) in float32 one would need at least 2x model size\\n  RAM: 1x for initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. So for GPT-J it would take at least 48GB\\n  RAM to just load the model. To reduce the RAM usage there are a few options. The `torch_dtype` argument can be\\n  used to initialize the model in half-precision on a CUDA device only. There is also a fp16 branch which stores the fp16 weights,\\n  which could be used to further minimize the RAM usage:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import GPTJForCausalLM\\n>>> import torch\\n\\n>>> device = \"cuda\"\\n>>> model = GPTJForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\n...     \"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\",\\n...     revision=\"float16\",\\n...     torch_dtype=torch.float16,\\n... ).to(device)\\n```\\n\\n- The model should fit on 16GB GPU for inference. For training/fine-tuning it would take much more GPU RAM. Adam\\n  optimizer for example makes four copies of the model: model, gradients, average and squared average of the gradients.\\n  So it would need at least 4x model size GPU memory, even with mixed precision as gradient updates are in fp32. This\\n  is not including the activations and data batches, which would again require some more GPU RAM. So one should explore\\n  solutions such as DeepSpeed, to train/fine-tune the model. Another option is to use the original codebase to\\n  train/fine-tune the model on TPU and then convert the model to Transformers format for inference. Instructions for\\n  that could be found [here](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/howto_finetune.md)\\n\\n- Although the embedding matrix has a size of 50400, only 50257 entries are used by the GPT-2 tokenizer. These extra\\n  tokens are added for the sake of efficiency on TPUs. To avoid the mismatch between embedding matrix size and vocab\\n  size, the tokenizer for [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) contains 143 extra tokens\\n  `<|extratoken_1|>... <|extratoken_143|>`, so the `vocab_size` of tokenizer also becomes 50400.\\n\\n## Usage examples\\n\\nThe [`~generation.GenerationMixin.generate`] method can be used to generate text using GPT-J\\nmodel.\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\\n\\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\\n\\n>>> prompt = (\\n...     \"In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, \"\\n...     \"previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the \"\\n...     \"researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.\"\\n... )\\n\\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\\n\\n>>> gen_tokens = model.generate(\\n...     input_ids,\\n...     do_sample=True,\\n...     temperature=0.9,\\n...     max_length=100,\\n... )\\n>>> gen_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(gen_tokens)[0]\\n```\\n\\n...or in float16 precision:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import GPTJForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\\n>>> import torch\\n\\n>>> device = \"cuda\"\\n>>> model = GPTJForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to(device)\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\\n\\n>>> prompt = (\\n...     \"In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, \"\\n...     \"previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the \"\\n...     \"researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.\"\\n... )\\n\\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(device)\\n\\n>>> gen_tokens = model.generate(\\n...     input_ids,\\n...     do_sample=True,\\n...     temperature=0.9,\\n...     max_length=100,\\n... )\\n>>> gen_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(gen_tokens)[0]\\n```\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\nA list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with GPT-J.
