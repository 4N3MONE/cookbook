    "\n",
    "Since there are so many moving parts to tune with a big impact on performance, benchmarking the RAG system is crucial.\n",

    "For our evaluation pipeline, we will need:\n",
    "- an evaluation dataset\n",
    "- an evaluator to compute the accuracy of our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ It turns out, we can use LLMs to help us all along the way!\n",
    "- the evaluation dataset will be synthetically generated by an LLM 🤖, and questions will be filtered out by other LLMs 🤖\n",
    "- the evaluation will then be run on this synthetic dataset by a LLM-as-a-judge agent 🤖.\n",

    "- **Groundedness:** can the question be answered from the given context?\n",
    "- **Relevance:** is the question relevant to users? For instance, `\"What is the date when transformers 4.29.1 was released?\"` is not relevant for ML practicioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last failure case we've noticed is when a function is tailored for the particular setting where the question was generated, but undecipherable by itself, like `\"What is the name of the function used in this guide?\"`.\n",
    "We also build a critique agent for this criteria:\n",
    "- **Stand-alone**: is the question understandable free of any context, for someone with domain knowledge/Internet access? The opposite of this would be `What is the function used in this article?` for a question generated from a specific blog article.\n",
    "\n",
    "We systematically score functions with all these agents, and whenever the score is too low for any one of the agents, we eliminate the question from our eval dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 __When asking the agents to output a score, we first ask them to produce its rationale. This will help us verify scores, but most importantly, asking it to first output rationale gives the model more tokens to think and elaborate an answer before summarizing it into a single score token.__\n",

    "\n",
    "Out of [the different RAG evaluation metrics](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html), we choose to focus only on faithfulness since it the best end-to-end metric of our system's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We use GPT4 as a judge for its empirically good performance, but you could try with other models such as [kaist-ai/prometheus-13b-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/prometheus-13b-v1.0) or [BAAI/JudgeLM-33B-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/JudgeLM-33B-v1.0).\n",

If instead you give the judge LLM a vague scale to work with, the outputs will not be consistent enough inbetween examples.\n",
