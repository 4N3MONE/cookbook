# Open-Source AI Cookbook

This repo contains community-driven practical examples of building AI applications and solving various tasks with AI 
using open-source tools and models. 

## Contributing to the cookbook

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution! There are several ways you can contribute to 
the [Open-Source AI Cookbook](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/index):

* Submit an idea for a desired example/guide via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook/issues).
* Contribute a new notebook with a practical example.
* Improve existing examples by fixing issues/typos. 

Before contributing, check currently [open issues](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/huggingface/cookbook/pulls) to avoid working on something that someone else is
already working on.

### What makes a good Cookbook notebook?

We believe that the Cookbook will be the most beneficial for everyone in the community if the Jupyter notebooks have the 
following qualities: 

* *Practical*: Your notebook should provide an illustration of an end-to-end project or a specific aspect of AI development. Aim for real-world applications, but try to avoid overcomplicating. Clearly explain the objectives, challenges and steps involved.
* *Build with open-source tools and models*: Utilize open source libraries, datasets, and pre-trained models available under permissive licenses. Include links to all resources used within the notebook.
* *Clearly written*: Ensure your writing is clear, concise, and free from grammatical errors. Maintain a friendly and approachable tone throughout the notebook. Explain the steps you take to solve a problem, challenges, alternative approaches.
* *Executes without errors*: Test your notebook to avoid runtime errors. 
* *Adds to existing "recipes"*: Before submitting, review existing notebooks to confirm that the subject hasn't been covered yet. We welcome diverse use cases, modalities, techniques, and approaches! 

### Creating a pull request

When contributing a new example/guide, open a pull request and tag [@MKhalusova](https://github.com/MKhalusova) for a review.

If using any images in the markdown, upload them to 
the [huggingface/cookbook-images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images) dataset. Then use the 
link to the image in your markdown, e.g.:

```![RAG diagram](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/rag-diagram.png)```

Once your pull request is merged, the notebook will show up in the [Open-Source AI Cookbook](https://hf.co/learn/cookbook).
